# Damage Potential in Computer System

The project is a python-based implementation of my research work which aims at calculating the amount of damage potential of any insider within a computer system. The first phase proposes an algorithm to calculate the maximum rate at which any source process can send data to a target process. It uses the Push-Relabel algorithm to calculate the max flow. 

### Prerequisites

Python 3.0 or higher 


## Running the tests

Test with basic parameters - python /path_to_tests/sample_test_basic

Test with basic parameters - python /path_to_tests/sample_test_basic

### Break down into end to end tests

Test with basic parameters - It tests the max flow algorithm with a basic set of vertices, edges and capabilities. 

```
Change the value of the capacity and rate of the edges before its creation and see the expected max flow in the answer.
The capbilities added to the newly created process  
```
